<h2>Textual Commentary</h2>
<h3>The Present Edition</h3>
<p>This edition of Mercedes of Castile is an eclectic text built up from witnesses whose preparation Cooper had control over.  These include the holograph manuscript in Cooper's hand (MS) and the Lea & Blanchard first American edition (A1), for which Cooper corrected proofs.  Following the example of the Cooper Edition, I have adopted the MS reading in cases where its text was likely corrupted during typesetting, and the A1 reading in cases where the change was likely to have been the result of author revision in the proof stage.  I have chosen to edit without a copy-text.  The idea of a copy-text suggests one witness to be more authoritative than another, and in this case I judge the MS and A1 to be of equal authority.  Furthermore, as G. Thomas Tanselle points out in his article "Editing without a Copy-text," the purpose of a copy-text is to have a witness that may provide a default reading, so to speak, when the editor otherwise does not know how to select a reading.   For every variant in my edition, I have been able to use my judgment to select what I deem to be the reading intended by Cooper; therefore, I have had no need of a witness whose readings I must default to.</p>
<p>Although this edition is built primarily from MS and A1 readings, in its preparation I collated all editions from within ten years after Cooper's death (1851), in order to take into account the possibility that he may have left instructions for revisions in subsequent editions.  (As far as the extant witnesses and correspondence show, Cooper never revised Mercedes, nor did he intend to do so.)  These included the Lea & Blanchard 1840 (A1), the first British edition by Bentley in London in 1841 (B1), the first French English-language editions by Galignani and Baudry (F1), American reprints by Stringer & Townsend in 1852 and 1856, and finally the 1859 Townsend edition of Cooper's Works.</p>
<h3>Note on the Manuscript</h3>
<p>Cooper's final-draft holograph manuscript (MS) is a part of the Clifton Waller Barrett Library of American Literature, housed in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library, at the University of Virginia.  The MS is complete with the exception of about two chapters containing part of Columbus' westward ocean voyage.  The MS is a set of folio sheets of lined paper, hardbound in blue leather.  Cooper wrote in pen on the rectos of the leaves, in a very small, tight hand, which is legible but does create difficulty in distinguishing vowels and capitalization.  Cooper left very little space unused on his MS, often running his words right to the edge of the paper.  He often writes the epigraph, or "motto," as he calls it, on the verso of the sheet.</p>
<p>Cooper's revisions to the MS are best understood in two categories: draft-stage revisions and later revisions.  While writing this draft, Cooper frequently made changes, sometimes striking out words immediately and writing new ones to the right of the deletion, and at other times coming back a moment later, striking through something, and then superlineating the new reading.  Cooper also revised his MS after he had finished it, and these later revisions can be distinguished by the fact that they are generally darker and finer than the original ink, which appears to have higher water content, and is consequently of a lighter color.  At certain points in the MS, the paper appears to have been damp during Cooper's drafting, as the original ink diffuses around the lines; yet the revisions themselves are sharp.  Consequently, I was able to very easily tell which revisions were from drafting, and which were from Cooper's final editing.  This MS thus represents two distinct stages of authorship, and is therefore excellent documentation of Cooper's writing and revision habits.</p>
<h3>First American Edition</h3>
<p>The Lea & Blanchard 1840 first American edition (A1) was set from Cooper's revised MS.  Many variants in the A1 result from compositors misreading Cooper's hand.  For instance, when, upon seeing Ozema, Luis's thoughts suddenly "reverted" to Mercedes in the MS, in A1, they "resorted" to herâ€”the compositor having misread Cooper's "ve" as "so."  In another instance, Mattinao enters a realm where his "rule" is recognized in the MS, but it is his "will" that is recognized in A1.  In such cases, through close examination of the MS, I have been able to restore the proper readings to the text.</p>
