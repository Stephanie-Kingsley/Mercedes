            mountains that were grouped inland, found its way through a smiling valley to the
            ocean.  This stream was neither broad nor deep, but it contained far more than water

            About this time, too, or just as they entered the mouth of the stream,

            dwelt habitually  beneath the shades of groves, or in the retirement of their dwellings,
            like persons of similar habits in Europe, might

            While he was thus employed, Ozema's head fell upon his breast, and the excited girl
            burst into tears.  This display of weakness, however, lasted but a moment

         <p>Luis soon perceived that his retreat from the house had not been made a moment too
            soon.  The family of Mattinao had already disappeared, and a strong party of the invaders
            was in full view, rushing madly  up the grove, silent, but evidently bent on seizing
            their prey.  He felt Ozema, who clung to his arm, tremble violently, and then he heard
            her murmuring

         <p>Luis understood the first part of this answer to mean that the stranger was  not the

             within twenty feet of his cover, our hero sprang lightly forward on the sward to
            meet his foes.  Two of the spears he received on his buckler, severing both shafts

            touch.  Making a sweep with the weapon in his front, its point seamed the breasts
            of the two astonished spearsmen, whose distance alone saved them from more serious
            injuries.

             execution struck the assailants with awe and dread.  Never before had they witnessed

             amputation of the arm struck them as something miraculous.  Even the ferocious Carib
            fell back in dismay, and Luis felt hopes of victory.  This was the first occasion
            on which the Spaniards had come to blows with the mild inhabitants of the islands
            they had discovered, though it is usual with the historians to refer to an incident

            of our hero struck him as much with admiration as with wonder.  After a few minutes

         <p>When the two adversaries met, it was with mutual respect and confidence.  The Carib
            made a short and vehement speech, in which the only word that was intelligible to
            our hero, was the name of the beautiful young Indian.  By this time Ozema had

            <span class="rdg F1 K B1 A1 P2 P1">also</span>

            if not eloquent.  He laid his hand frequently on his heart, and his voice became soft
            and persuasive.  Ozema replied earnestly
            
            <span class="rdg MS"></span>
