            While he was thus employed, Ozema's head fell upon his breast, and the excited girl
            burst into tears.  This display of weakness, however, lasted but a moment

         <p>Luis soon perceived that his retreat from the house had not been made a moment too
            soon.  The family of Mattinao had already disappeared, and a strong party of the invaders
            was in full view, rushing madly  up the grove, silent, but evidently bent on seizing
            their prey.  He felt Ozema, who clung to his arm, tremble violently, and then he heard

            ferocious Carib fell back in dismay, and Luis felt hopes of victory.  This was the
            first occasion on which the Spaniards had come to blows with the mild inhabitants
            of the islands they had discovered, though it is usual with the historians to refer

            made a short and vehement speech, in which the only word that was intelligible to
