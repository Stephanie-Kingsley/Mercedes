   <rdg wit="#MS">desire</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1 #K">view</rdg>
</app> to prove that there never were such persons as our hero and heroine, and fancy that by establishing these facts, they completely destroy the authenticity of the whole book.  
<app type="rev">
   <rdg wit="#MS">All that we have to say in answer to this anticipated objection is</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1 #K">In answer to this anticipated objection, we will state,</rdg>

   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1 #K">several</rdg>
</app> of the Spanish writers, from Cervantes to the translator of the journal of Columbus, the Alpha and Omega of peninsular literature, and after having read both Irving and Prescott from beginning to end, we

   <rdg wit="#MS">can</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1 #K">do</rdg>
</app> not find a syllable in either of them, that we understand to be conclusive evidence, or indeed

</app>  Until some solid affirmative proof, therefore, can be produced against us, we shall hold our case to be made out, and rest our claims to be believed on the authority of our own statements.  Nor do we think there is 
<app type="orth">

</app> offered to the credence of the

   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #K">American</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#B1 #F1"></rdg>
</app> public, rests on the same species of testimony
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #K">, </rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1">,--</rdg>
</app>with the trifling difference that we state truths, with a profession of fiction, while the great moral caterers of the age state fiction with the profession of truth.  If any advantage can be fairly obtained over us, in consequence of this trifling discrepancy, we must

   <rdg wit="#MS #K">fain</rdg>

</app> submit.
</p>
<p>
There is one point, notwithstanding, concerning which it may be well to be frank
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #K">,</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1"></rdg>
</app> at once.  The narrative of the &quot;Voyage to Cathay
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #K">,</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#B1 #F1"></rdg>
</app>&quot; has been written with the journal of the Admiral before us
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #B1 #K">;</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#F1">,</rdg>
</app> or 
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #B1 #K">,</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#F1"></rdg>
</app>rather with all of that journal
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #K">,</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1"></rdg>
</app> 
<app type="style">
   <rdg wit="#MS">that</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1 #K">which</rdg>
</app> has been given to the world through the agency of a very incompetent and 
<app type="orth">
   <rdg wit="#MS #K">meager</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1">meagre</rdg>
</app> editor.  Nothing is plainer than the general fact that this person did not always understand his author
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS A1 #K">,</rdg>
   <rdg wit="#B1 #F1">;</rdg>
</app> and in one particular circumstance he has written so obscurely, as not a little to embarass even a novelist, whose functions naturally include an entire familiarity with the thoughts, emotions, characters, and, occasionally, with the unknown fates of the subjects of his pen.  The nautical day formerly commenced at

</app> 
<app type="punc">

</app> and
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #K"></rdg>
   <rdg wit="#B1 #F1">,</rdg>
</app>with all our native ingenuity and high professional prerogatives
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #K"></rdg>
   <rdg wit="#B1 #F1">,</rdg>
</app> we have not been able to discover whether the editor of the journal has adopted that mode of counting time, or whether he has condescended to use the more vulgar and irrational practice of landsmen.  It is our opinion, however, that in the spirit of impartiality which becomes an historian
<app type="punc">
   <rdg wit="#MS #K"></rdg>
   <rdg wit="#A1 #B1 #F1">,</rdg>
   </app> he has adopted both.  

   
<app type="pub">
   <rdg wit="#MS #A1 #K">This little peculiarity might possibly embarrass a

      </app> but accurate critics being so very common, we feel no concern on this head, well knowing that they will be much more apt to wink at these minor inconsistencies, than to pass over an error of the press, or a comma with a broken tail.  As we wish to live on good terms with this useful class of our

<p>As respects the minor characters of this work, very little need be said.  Every one knows that Columbus had seamen in  his vessels, and that he brought some of the natives of the islands he had discovered

Our hero would not have been a true lover, had he remained indifferent to the glories of the natural scenery that lay spread before his eyes, as he thus coasted the shores of Espanola.  The boldness of the landscape, as in the Mediterranean, was relieved by the softness of a low latitude, which throws some such witchery around rocks and

   By this time, indeed, the natives had coasted as far as they intended, and were turning in towards the entrance of a small stream, which, taking its rise among the noble mountains that were grouped inland, found its way through  a smiling valley to the ocean.  This stream was neither broad nor deep, but it contained far more than water sufficient for any craft used by the natives.  Its banks were fringed with bushes
