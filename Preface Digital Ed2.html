            Our hero would not have been a true lover, had he remained indifferent to the glories
            of the natural scenery that lay spread before his eyes, as he thus coasted the shores
            of Espanola.  The boldness of the landscape, as in the Mediterranean, was relieved

            ornaments of jet, and the teeth that were visible between lips like cherries, resembled
            rows of ivory.  We have said that the eyes of Ozema were black, differing in this

            touch.  Making a sweep with the weapon in his front, its point seamed the breasts
            of the two astonished spearsmen, whose distance alone saved them from more serious
