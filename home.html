<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>The Editorial Project</h3>
<p>James Fenimore Cooper is well known as the author of the Leatherstocking Tales, novels which set the character of Natty Bumppo against the backdrop of the American wilderness and various important historical moments in the colonial and founding era.  He was also one of the most widely read authors of the early nineteenth century, and through his success helped to promote American literature beyond national borders.  Cooper's works have, consequently, received a great deal of editorial attention.  Thirty-one out of Cooper's thirty-six titles have been edited according to standards of modern textual criticism for "The Writings of James Fenimore Cooper" or are currently being prepared for inclusion in the series by members of the Cooper Society.</p>
<p>A novel of Cooper's which has not been edited but which is nonetheless a vital member of his corpus is Mercedes of Castile.  Published in 1840, Mercedes of Castile is one of Cooper's least-known works.  Most students of American literature do not realize that Cooper, along with other notable figures as Washington Irving and William H. Prescott, wrote on the first voyage of Christopher Columbus.  The subject was one of great fascination for Cooper, and his treatment of it constitutes a unique approach to historiography which, in addition to other issues such as race and gender relations, makes Mercedes of Castile a work worthy of further study.  To enable this study and produce a reliable text which reflects Cooper's final intentions for this important novel, I have chosen to prepare a critical edition of the work.</p>
<p>In Mercedes of Castile, Cooper sets the first voyage of Christopher Columbus within the fictional story of Luis de Bobadilla, a Spanish nobleman, and Mercedes de Valverde, a Castilian heiress—both living in the court of Ferdinand and Isabella.  Luis desires to marry Mercedes, but Isabella views his suit unfavorably because he has the reputation of a wanderer, having indulged in too many sea explorations.  While the Spanish court is living in the freshly conquered Alhambra, the final stronghold of the Arab Muslim kings, Columbus comes to request the patronage of the Spanish monarchs.  Mercedes prompts Luis to accompany Columbus and restore his honor, and it is partly Mercedes's interests which persuade Isabella to sponsor Columbus.  Cooper retells Columbus's westward voyage, with Luis acting as the great navigator's confidante.  When they reach Cuba, Luis meets the Indian princess Ozema, whom he and Columbus take back to Spain as a "specimen" to show Isabella.  In the course of the voyage, Ozema falls in love with Luis, thinking he has plighted his troth to her by presenting a crucifix to her, when he only meant the gift to be a safeguard during a storm.  Upon reaching Spain, Ozema discovers Luis is engaged to Mercedes and ultimately dies of illness and disappointment.</p>
<p>The present edition includes only Cooper's Preface and Chapter 23.  The Preface is of particular interest for Cooper's sometimes whimsical, sometimes curmudgeonly, commentary on history.  He declares that his work of romantic historical fiction delves deeper than the "slight and superficial researches"  conducted by previous works on Columbus, and he attacks Irving for his apparently inconsistent treatment of nautical time in his The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus (1828).  The Preface also includes commentary which firmly situates Mercedes in the context of Cooper's Press Wars, in which he sued multiple newspaper editors for libel.  It is thus a fascinating glimpse not only into Mercedes, but into a tumultuous moment in the life of its author.  Chapter 23 features Luis exploring Haiti, meeting Ozema, and defending her from a rival chieftain who wishes to kidnap her and make her his bride.  The chapter is of interest because it shows, according to Cooper, "the first occasion on which the Spaniards had come to blows with the mild inhabitants of the islands they had discovered."   The central feature of the chapter is the extensive description of Ozema, who is depicted as a doppelganger of Mercedes, so nearly does she resemble Luis's Spanish love.</p>
<p>The present edition is preceded by a historical introduction describing the development of the idea of Mercedes of Castile, its publication, its contemporary reception, and its critical importance.  I have chosen to present a clear text, with a minimum of explanatory notes listed at the back of the text, so that it will be approachable both to scholars and general readers.  The explanatory notes provide contextual knowledge which contemporary readers would have had, but which the modern reader may lack.  It will thus enable readers to experience Cooper's text with as little distraction as possible while providing essential historical knowledge, thus approximating the original reading experience of Cooper's own readers.   The apparatus includes the "Textual History," which is a discussion of the various stages of revision and corruption which Cooper's text has undergone, and textual notes explaining particularly important textual variants are to be found immediately after the textual history.  Cooper's handwriting was especially prone to misreading during composition, and compositors freely changed his punctuation—to name only a couple ways in which his work was altered against his wishes in the course of publication.  By collating, or comparing word for word, the manuscript and the printed editions published during Cooper's lifetime, I traced these changes.  Scouring publisher records and Cooper correspondence at the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library (Yale), the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library (University of Virginia), I gathered details about Cooper's personal life and publishing practices.  Guided by these discoveries, I analyzed each change in the text and determined which reading best represented Cooper's final intentions for Mercedes.  Thus, the text of Mercedes of Castile which Cooper wished his readers to experience is presented for the first time ever in this edition.</p>
<p>In preparing this edition, I chose to edit without a copy-text, taking the majority of my readings from the author's holograph manuscript and the first American edition.  The "Editorial Principles" provides a detailed account of my treatment of the different types of textual variants, such as wording, capitalization, punctuation, etc.  The "Historical Collation" lists all variants between the manuscript and contemporary printed editions.  These supplementary materials will provide interested readers with a thorough understanding of the origin and evolution of the text which they encounter in this edition.</p>

<h3>The Digital Edition</h3>
<p><i>Mercedes of Castile</i>: a Digital Edition is a project submitted to the Rare Book School for the RBS-UVA Fellowship.  This project is a parallel project to my Master's thesis, <i>Mercedes of Castile</i>: a Critical Edition.  After collating the author's final draft holograph manuscript and the editions published in Cooper's lifetime, I was able to use that evidence to determine Cooper's final intentions for his novel.  For my thesis, I presented my own edition text as a clear text, then listed the textual variants in a Historical Collation in the back of the thesis.  Being interested in the application of digital technology to textual editing, however, I wanted to create a digital edition, as well.</p>
<p>I conducted my collations using Juxta Commons Collation Software.  Using Juxta, I output TEI files which employed Parallel Segmentation formatting to mark up the variants.  This file provided me a place to begin my own markup.  I edited the TEI file extensively, adding manuscript details, such as additions and deletions.  I also added types to the variants, such as "revision," "compositor error," "publisher," "capitalization," "punctuation," etc.  I also revised the way Juxta marked up the variants considerably.  My final XML file now contains a wealth of bibliographical and editorial analysis.</p>
<p>My goal for my edition was to have a way for readers to read the text while having the apparatus at their fingertips while reading--something possible with digital editions.  While reading my edition, readers can click on a variant they are interested in, and a popover window will display a list of the readings of all the witnesses.  Readers may also change between texts while reading.  In addition to providing my own critical text, I also have the texts of the first American edition, first British edition, and first French English-language edition.  A floating navigation with tabs to these texts means that halfway through my text, if a reader wanted to change from the Kingsley edition to the American, he or she can do so by simply clicking the appropriate tab.  The text will change instantly without the page needing to refresh.</p>
<p>In addition to providing an easy way of viewing collation results, my digital edition also provides a vast amount of interpretation which I have generated over the course of working with <i>Mercedes</i>.  I include the diplomatic transcription of the manuscript, which was a key source for me in establishing my edition.  Having the text of the manuscript easily accessible--and with the diplomatic markup--means that users of my edition can see how Cooper revised his work over time.  Another way in which I incorporate my own interpretation into the digital edition is by including the texts of interpolated proof stages, marked with the changes which I believe Cooper to have made in these proof stages.  For the evidence I use to establish this, see my <a href="textual.html">Textual Commentary</a>, which provides a full textual history and account of my editorial practices.</p>
<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<p>My plan was to create a digital edition which provided users an easy way to instantly view the relationships between the variant readings.  To do this, my initial plan was to have each popover display a Dendogram (D3 library) visualization of the readings, such as the following:</p>
<img>
<p>Unfortunately, time did not permit me to learn the complex JavaScript and XSLT needed to write the code necessary.  This is, however, something I would love to learn how to do, and when I do, I will incorporate this visualization in the digital edition.</p>
